# Configuring HTTPDuck As a Receptor

This configuration allows you to record a http request and define the expected response

## Step 1
Go to Receptions section in the navigation bar and simply click on "Create Reception" button.

## Step 2
Then you will be directed to the reception definition page where you'll be given with a specific HTTP/S URL where you can send HTTP requests which are supposed to be recorded. In this view you can configure any property of the HTTP response you expect.

Once you are done with defining the HTTP response just click on Update buton to save the definition. Or you can just delete the HTTP reception definition. 

## Step 3
In this view you'll be able to select a particular reception to view associated HTTP requests/responses.

## Step 4
Provide the URL generated by HTTPDuck as the target endpoint inorder to capture the http request/response. For the sake of simplicity I will use curl in this example.

`curl -get -v https://kanishkapagero.alwaysdata.net/reception/5c29a630cdca734088705112`

Result

The response body and all the http response parameters are highlighted in the above screenshot. Notice that the value are there as we customized in the HTTP response definition.

## Step 5
Finally it's possible to view the requests captured by the HTTPDuck.
